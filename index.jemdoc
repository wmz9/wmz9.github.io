== About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in Computational Mathematics, [https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences], [https://english.pku.edu.cn/ Peking University] (2021-Present). I am very fortunate to be advised by [https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/ Prof. Weinan E]. Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Pure and Applied Mathematics (ranking 1/111 for the first three years during my undergraduate study) from [http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/ School of Mathematical Sciences], [https://www.zju.edu.cn/ Zhejiang University], Hangzhou, China in 2021.

== Research Interests
I am broadly interested in theory, algorithm and application of machine learning. I am also interested in non-convex and convex optimization. 

Recently, I am dedicated to use theory to design algorithms elegantly. 

My recent research topics are
- *Deep Learning Theory*: *expressivity*, *optimization*, *generalization*, and *implicit bias*. \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]\[6\]\[8\]\[9\]\[10\]\[11\]\[12\]\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]\[16\]\[17\]\[18\]
- *Transformer* and *Large Language Model*: theory and algorithm, especially in LLM pre-training. \[8\]\[10\]\[12\]\[13\]\[16\]\[17\]\[18\]
- *Non-convex* and *Convex Optimization*: theory and algorithm. \[2\]\[4\]\[6\]\[10\]\[11\]\[12\]\[13\]\[14\]\[15\]\[18\]

Specifically, my research on deep learning theory and algorithm can be summarized as:
