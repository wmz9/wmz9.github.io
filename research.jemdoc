== Research Interests
I am broadly interested in theory, algorithm and application of machine learning. I am also interested in non-convex and convex optimization. Recently, I am dedicated to to use theory to design algorithms elegantly. 

Specifically, my recent research topics are
- *Deep Learning Theory*: optimization, generalization, implicit bias, and approximation.
-- +Optimization+: When training neural networks, why can optimization algorithms converge to global minima? \[1\]\[4\]
-- +Implicit Bias+: When training neural networks, why can optimization algorithms converge to global minima with favorable generalization ability (even without any explicit regularization)? Such as flat-minima-bias \[2\]\[5\] and max-margin-bias aspects \[4\]\[6\].
-- +Algorithm Design+: For machine learning problems, design new optimization algorithms which can converge to global minima with better generalization ability. \[6\]\[10\]
-- +Approximation+: Exploring the expressive power of deep neural networks through the lens of approximation theory. \[7\] 
-- +Generalization+: How to measure the generalization ability of neural networks. \[3\]
- *Transformer and Large Language Model*: theory and algorithm.
-- +Expressive Power+: The expressive power and mechanisms of Transformer \[7\]. (On the preparation)
-- +Algorithm Design+: Design faster optimizers for pre-training LLMs \[10\].
- *Non-convex and Convex Optimization*: theory and algorithm.
-- +Convex Optimization in ML+. \[6\]
-- +Non-convex Optimization in ML+. \[1\]\[4\]\[10\]
- *CV and NLP*: algorithm and application. \[9\]\[10\]
