== About me
I am a third-year Ph.D student in Computational Mathematics, [https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences], [https://english.pku.edu.cn/ Peking University] (2021-Present). I am very fortunate to be advised by [https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/ Prof. Weinan E]. Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Pure and Applied Mathematics (ranking 1/111 for the first three years during my undergraduate study) from [http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/ School of Mathematical Sciences], [https://www.zju.edu.cn/ Zhejiang University], Hangzhou, China in 2021.

== Research Interests
I am broadly interested in theory, algorithm and application of machine learning. I am also interested in non-convex and convex optimization. Specifically, my recent research topics are
- *Deep Learning Theory*: optimization, generalization, and implicit bias. \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]\[6\]
- *Transformer and Large Language Model*: theory and algorithm. (On the preparation)
- *Non-convex and Convex Optimization*: theory and algorithm. \[1\]\[4\]\[6\]
- *CV and NLP*: algorithm and application.
- *AI for Compositional Optimization*: theory and algorithm.
